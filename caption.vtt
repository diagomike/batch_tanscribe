00:00.378 --> 00:08.378
One thing is certain, if you stick to the word, you will come back with a testimony.

00:08.378 --> 00:12.378
What God wants to give you in your life is not a healing.

00:12.378 --> 00:15.378
What God wants to give you in your life is not a job.

00:15.378 --> 00:17.378
What God wants to give you in your life is not money.

00:17.378 --> 00:22.378
What God wants to give you is the word of God in your spirit.

00:22.378 --> 00:28.114
It will make you what it talks about.

00:29.114 --> 00:34.114
And you are shining. And you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.

00:34.114 --> 00:37.114
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.

00:37.114 --> 00:40.114
You are shining and nothing can stop you.

00:40.114 --> 00:43.114
It is your season. It is your time.

00:43.114 --> 00:46.114
Nothing can hinder you.

00:46.114 --> 00:50.114
This is your time. This is your hour.

00:50.114 --> 00:53.114
The favor is yours.

01:04.026 --> 01:23.178
In the past couple of weeks, we've been studying something I regard as necessary for every

01:23.178 --> 01:37.042
child of God to know and understand, and we titled it, what?

01:37.042 --> 01:39.522
Anticipating Evil.

01:39.522 --> 01:43.034
Anticipating Evil.

01:43.034 --> 01:52.826
And I think that for, to some measure, we got some distance Wednesday night.

01:52.826 --> 02:03.226
So I want to take another step farther in a subject, to begin a subject that I believe

02:03.226 --> 02:18.762
will help you not only understand all of what we already dealt with in the past few weeks,

02:18.762 --> 02:29.986
but also to give you a further advantage.

02:29.986 --> 02:35.226
The title is, The Human Spirit.

02:35.226 --> 02:43.586
I want to talk to you about the human spirit, because in dealing with anticipating evil,

02:43.586 --> 02:51.746
we had to talk a lot about the development of the human spirit, all right?

02:51.746 --> 03:02.290
So I thought that I should just get into that subject itself and see what more we could

03:02.290 --> 03:04.370
gain.

03:04.370 --> 03:10.530
You know, all the schools of the world, the primary schools, the secondary schools, the

03:10.650 --> 03:19.650
universities and colleges of technology and so on, are all there to help you develop your

03:19.650 --> 03:28.410
mind, make you a great mental giant.

03:28.410 --> 03:31.530
That's what all those schools are for.

03:31.530 --> 03:39.218
Then there are other schools that help you develop your physical body.

03:39.218 --> 03:47.082
Some of you go to the gym just because you want to keep fit.

03:47.082 --> 03:51.482
Some others want to tone down somehow.

03:51.482 --> 03:58.266
Some are concerned about a lot of fat they put on and trying to get rid of it.

03:58.266 --> 04:03.506
And so there are those who have studied so much about the physical body and they are

04:03.506 --> 04:09.146
helping to straighten you out about your physical body.

04:09.146 --> 04:12.826
They even tell you what kind of food to eat.

04:12.826 --> 04:18.466
But there are not many schools that teach on the human spirit.

04:18.466 --> 04:28.314
Incidentally, that's the most important of all three of them.

04:28.314 --> 04:34.434
First Thessalonians chapter 5, a scripture that I already gave you when we were studying

04:34.434 --> 04:40.794
the past subject.

04:56.634 --> 05:02.634
Alright, chapter number 5 now. I want you to read for me verse 23. 1, 2, go.

05:15.066 --> 05:21.066
In the very God of peace sanctify you wholly, completely.

05:22.066 --> 05:27.066
And I pray God your whole spirit, did you notice?

05:27.066 --> 05:36.066
Your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

05:36.066 --> 05:39.066
Your whole spirit and soul and body.

05:40.066 --> 05:56.834
Let's move over to St. John's Gospel and have a look at Jesus' encounter with the woman whom he met at the well of Samaria.

05:57.834 --> 06:00.834
St. John's Gospel chapter number 4.

06:08.410 --> 06:12.410
You know, he had asked the woman to give him water to drink, and the woman said,

06:12.410 --> 06:17.410
You know, you are a Jew and I am a Samaritan, we don't have anything in common.

06:17.410 --> 06:19.410
Why should you ask me for water?

06:19.410 --> 06:23.410
Jesus said, If you knew the one who's asking you for water, you would ask him for water.

06:23.410 --> 06:28.410
And he would give you, what kind of water?

06:28.410 --> 06:31.410
Living water.

06:31.410 --> 06:34.410
Such that you'd never have to come back here to draw water.

06:34.410 --> 06:39.410
And she said to Jesus, You don't have anything to draw the water from the well, and the well is deep.

06:39.410 --> 06:43.834
How can you have that living water?

06:43.834 --> 06:45.834
An interesting dialogue.

06:45.834 --> 06:53.834
Well then, she had a question for Jesus, and I want to read from verse 19.

06:53.834 --> 06:59.834
The woman said unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.

06:59.834 --> 07:01.834
My father's worshipped in this mountain.

07:01.834 --> 07:05.834
And ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.

07:05.834 --> 07:09.834
You know, she's come up with a denominational question now.

07:09.834 --> 07:14.834
Jesus said unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh,

07:14.834 --> 07:20.834
when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.

07:20.834 --> 07:23.834
Ye worship ye know not what.

07:23.834 --> 07:26.834
We know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews.

07:26.834 --> 07:29.834
But the hour cometh.

07:29.834 --> 07:35.466
Are you looking at verse 23?

07:35.466 --> 07:39.466
The hour cometh, and now is,

07:39.466 --> 07:47.466
when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth.

07:47.466 --> 07:51.466
For the Father seeketh such to worship him.

07:51.466 --> 07:57.466
The hour cometh, and now is,

07:58.466 --> 08:04.570
when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth.

08:04.570 --> 08:10.570
For the Father seeketh such to worship him.

08:10.570 --> 08:13.642
God is a spirit.

08:13.642 --> 08:15.642
Hallelujah.

08:15.642 --> 08:18.642
Jesus is preaching to this woman here.

08:18.642 --> 08:21.642
God is a spirit.

08:21.642 --> 08:24.642
And they that worship him must,

08:25.642 --> 08:31.994
must worship him in spirit and in truth.

08:31.994 --> 08:40.986
You know that a lot of people think that they say,

08:40.986 --> 08:42.986
let us worship in spirit now.

08:42.986 --> 08:44.986
And when they say let us worship in spirit,

08:44.986 --> 08:46.986
everybody goes like this, quiet.

08:56.474 --> 08:59.034
Then they come back.

08:59.034 --> 09:04.498
To them, they have worshipped in the Spirit.

09:04.498 --> 09:09.298
Then some others go, praise the Lord, sing, sing, praise the Lord.

09:09.298 --> 09:13.098
Then they say, okay, now, now, now, let us do it in the Spirit.

09:13.098 --> 09:19.378
Praise the Lord, sing, sing.

09:19.378 --> 09:22.098
They think if they take it slowly, that is worship.

09:22.098 --> 09:26.890
If they sing it fast, that is praise.

09:26.890 --> 09:28.970
Praise is fast.

09:28.970 --> 09:30.490
And dance.

09:30.490 --> 09:31.490
Worship is...

09:31.490 --> 09:34.850
Hallelujah.

09:40.794 --> 09:46.090
Hallelujah, Hallelujah.

09:46.090 --> 09:47.090
Then you get tired.

09:47.090 --> 09:48.090
Hallelujah.

09:56.250 --> 10:07.250
So, different people have the interpretation of what it is to wash up in the spirit.

10:07.250 --> 10:11.010
But this is not right.

10:11.010 --> 10:13.850
It doesn't mean that if you sing the song slowly, you are now in the spirit.

10:13.850 --> 10:20.250
It doesn't mean that if you shut your eyes and shut your trap, then you're in the spirit.

10:20.250 --> 10:21.250
No.

10:21.250 --> 10:25.250
No, a thousand times no.

10:26.674 --> 10:28.674
A thousand times no.

10:28.674 --> 10:42.674
It's not the modus operandi that decides whether it is spiritual or not.

10:42.674 --> 10:44.674
It's the source.

10:44.674 --> 10:46.674
Where it's coming from.

10:47.778 --> 10:49.778
Where it's coming from.

10:49.778 --> 10:51.778
Where it's coming from.

10:51.778 --> 10:58.778
Is it coming from the body and his senses?

10:59.778 --> 11:04.226
Is it coming, I'll tell you about that in a moment.

11:04.226 --> 11:09.226
Is it coming from the soul and his mind?

11:10.226 --> 11:13.394
Or is it coming from the spirit?

11:14.394 --> 11:15.818
Hallelujah.

11:16.818 --> 11:18.818
So God is a spirit.

11:18.818 --> 11:22.818
And those who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.

11:22.818 --> 11:28.818
Now, worshiping him in spirit means it's got to come from your spirit.

11:29.818 --> 11:32.818
Its origin is the spirit.

11:34.818 --> 11:36.818
It's got to come from your spirit.

11:36.818 --> 11:41.818
Now, many people have never understood the difference between the spirit and their mind.

11:42.818 --> 11:44.818
They think their mind is the spirit.

11:45.818 --> 11:47.818
They're not the same.

11:48.818 --> 11:54.434
When you were born again, it was not your body that was born again.

11:54.434 --> 11:57.434
It was not your mind that was born again.

11:57.434 --> 12:00.434
It was your spirit that was born again.

12:06.330 --> 12:10.330
Somebody said, when I was born again, I felt different.

12:10.330 --> 12:11.754
Where did you feel different?

12:11.754 --> 12:13.754
In your body?

12:13.754 --> 12:15.754
Or in your mind?

12:15.754 --> 12:18.754
Some, because they didn't understand that,

12:18.754 --> 12:20.754
three weeks after they were born again,

12:20.754 --> 12:23.754
they found themselves thinking the same wrong thoughts.

12:23.754 --> 12:25.754
Because, you know, now when they were born again,

12:25.754 --> 12:27.754
everything was just so nice.

12:27.754 --> 12:28.754
They went back telling all their friends,

12:28.754 --> 12:30.754
you see, I'm now a Christian.

12:30.754 --> 12:32.754
I don't want to do things I used to do.

12:32.754 --> 12:33.754
I do them no more.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.754
So they made that clear to their friends.

12:35.754 --> 12:37.754
I don't do this anymore.

12:37.754 --> 12:39.754
And then they were so expectant that their mind

12:39.754 --> 12:43.754
would now be very holy, and it was holy.

12:43.754 --> 12:45.754
But in the process of time,

12:45.754 --> 12:48.754
the old thoughts they used to have began to come back.

12:48.754 --> 12:51.754
And they thought, wait a minute, I thought I was born again.

12:51.754 --> 12:54.754
The devil said, no, you're not.

12:54.754 --> 12:59.754
They thought, how can a born again person be thinking evil?

12:59.754 --> 13:01.562
If they used to fight,

13:01.562 --> 13:04.562
and somebody did something wrong against them,

13:04.562 --> 13:07.562
that mind that used to say, go and kill him.

13:07.562 --> 13:11.562
Kill him, finish him.

13:11.562 --> 13:13.570
Now he's thinking like that again, and he says,

13:13.570 --> 13:16.570
I thought I was born again.

13:16.570 --> 13:19.570
And then there's this argument in his mind.

13:19.570 --> 13:22.674
Finish him.

13:22.674 --> 13:25.674
God will forgive you when you finish.

13:25.674 --> 13:29.538
Then he says, I don't think I'm a Christian.

13:29.538 --> 13:30.538
The devil says, I told you you are not a Christian.

13:30.538 --> 13:31.538
It's very hard.

13:31.538 --> 13:33.538
Very hard to be a Christian.

13:33.538 --> 13:35.538
Before you can be a Christian, hey.

13:38.538 --> 13:43.754
So the guy thinks.

13:43.754 --> 13:44.754
He decides to give up.

13:44.754 --> 13:46.754
Not only should you just give up, don't go to church again.

13:46.754 --> 13:50.754
Because if you go, they expect you to be a Christian Christian,

13:50.754 --> 13:51.754
and you are just Christian.

13:51.754 --> 13:54.754
So Christian Christian is a serious one.

13:54.754 --> 13:56.754
You are not a serious one yet.

13:56.754 --> 13:59.754
After like three years, you can try again.

14:00.754 --> 14:02.754
So he stops coming to church.

14:02.754 --> 14:05.754
He's given up.

14:05.754 --> 14:09.954
You go and reach him to witness to him and try to bring him back to church.

14:09.954 --> 14:13.954
He lets you understand his difficulty.

14:13.954 --> 14:19.954
If the devil keeps talking to him, the next time he sees you, he runs away.

14:19.954 --> 14:26.402
You're coming to invite him for Sunday service, he's looking at you from a corner.

14:26.402 --> 14:30.402
He even prays to God, God, don't let him see me.

14:30.402 --> 14:34.874
Don't let him see me.

14:34.874 --> 14:40.874
God, do not let him see you to take you to church.

14:40.874 --> 14:44.874
And after he's gone, he says, thank God.

14:44.874 --> 14:49.010
The same God is trying to take you to go and meet in church for worship.

14:49.010 --> 14:54.010
He's helping you to make sure the person he sent does not see you.

14:54.010 --> 14:59.010
No. No. No.

14:59.010 --> 15:03.010
Those thoughts may come back.

15:03.010 --> 15:07.106
Evil thoughts may come back to your mind.

15:07.106 --> 15:12.106
Because it's not your mind that was born again when you were born again.

15:12.106 --> 15:15.106
It was your spirit.

15:15.106 --> 15:22.066
Your mind can still harbor some really dirty thoughts.

15:22.066 --> 15:24.066
So what are you going to do?

15:24.066 --> 15:26.066
Okay.

15:26.066 --> 15:28.066
Are you in this place?

15:28.066 --> 15:31.066
Romans chapter 12.

15:31.066 --> 15:35.730
Have you found it?

15:35.730 --> 15:40.730
I want to read from verse 1, Romans chapter 12.

15:40.730 --> 15:45.570
Paul is writing to these Roman Christians here and he says,

15:45.570 --> 15:53.570
I beseech you therefore brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye, everybody say ye.

15:53.570 --> 15:55.570
Who are ye?

15:55.570 --> 15:57.570
What do you mean ye?

15:57.570 --> 16:01.570
Ye is old King James language for you in plural.

16:01.570 --> 16:02.570
Okay?

16:02.570 --> 16:03.570
Good.

16:03.570 --> 16:04.570
Ye.

16:04.570 --> 16:06.570
Somebody said he was talking to ye, not me.

16:06.570 --> 16:09.570
No.

16:09.570 --> 16:14.898
Ye refers to you in plural.

16:14.898 --> 16:17.898
All of you.

16:17.898 --> 16:23.898
I beseech you therefore brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies.

16:23.898 --> 16:25.898
Ye present your bodies.

16:25.898 --> 16:26.898
Uh-oh.

16:26.898 --> 16:27.898
That means I'm not a body.

16:27.898 --> 16:30.898
He says for me to present my body.

16:30.898 --> 16:32.898
I should present my body.

16:32.898 --> 16:34.898
So you see I have a body.

16:34.898 --> 16:37.898
I should present my body.

16:37.898 --> 16:39.898
So I'm not my body.

16:39.898 --> 16:45.898
So he says that ye present your bodies, a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,

16:45.898 --> 16:47.898
which is your reasonable service.

16:47.898 --> 16:48.898
Verse 2.

16:48.898 --> 16:51.898
And be not conformed to this word.

16:51.898 --> 16:54.898
Don't be like the rest of this world.

16:54.898 --> 16:57.898
Don't conform to their ways of doing things.

16:58.898 --> 17:00.898
Somebody says everybody cheats now.

17:00.898 --> 17:01.898
Everybody lies now.

17:01.898 --> 17:02.898
You are not everybody.

17:02.898 --> 17:06.898
He's telling you be not conformed to this world.

17:06.898 --> 17:10.898
Be not conformed to this world.

17:10.898 --> 17:13.194
Be not conformed to this world.

17:13.194 --> 17:17.194
You are all selling in the same market.

17:17.194 --> 17:21.202
And everybody is using an uneven balance.

17:21.202 --> 17:24.202
He says don't do it.

17:24.202 --> 17:26.202
Don't do it.

17:29.962 --> 17:32.962
Don't buy a fake passport because people are buying fake passports.

17:32.962 --> 17:34.962
Don't do it.

17:34.962 --> 17:38.034
He says don't do it.

17:43.834 --> 17:45.834
Don't do it.

17:50.458 --> 17:54.458
You don't even have a bank account, you have framed bank statements.

17:54.458 --> 17:58.458
You've designed them by yourself and forwarded them to the embassy.

17:58.458 --> 18:02.458
Because some other people did the same thing. Don't do it!

18:02.458 --> 18:08.458
You'll get in trouble somewhere along the line. Not with men, but with God.

18:09.458 --> 18:11.786
Don't do it!

18:17.306 --> 18:18.306
Don't do it.

18:18.306 --> 18:22.306
He says, be not conformed to this world.

18:22.306 --> 18:25.306
Be not conformed to this world.

18:25.306 --> 18:28.306
Don't be like the rest of them.

18:33.242 --> 18:36.242
Don't accept their ways.

18:36.242 --> 18:43.130
Be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed.

18:43.130 --> 18:46.130
Hallelujah.

18:46.130 --> 18:50.130
Look at it. Be ye transformed.

18:50.130 --> 18:56.154
It's a metamorphosis.

18:56.154 --> 18:59.154
A transfiguration.

18:59.154 --> 19:06.242
That's what it's saying here. Be ye transformed.

19:06.242 --> 19:09.242
A change.

19:09.242 --> 19:14.242
From one state to another. From one glory level to another.

19:14.242 --> 19:17.242
Be ye transformed.

19:17.242 --> 19:19.698
How?

19:19.698 --> 19:23.698
By the renewing of your mind.

19:23.698 --> 19:26.698
How important your mind is.

19:26.698 --> 19:29.698
By the renewing of your mind.

19:29.698 --> 19:32.698
He says through the renewing of your mind,

19:32.698 --> 19:38.698
you will experience a transformation by way of a metamorphosis.

19:38.698 --> 19:43.698
Which means you go from one level of glory to another.

19:43.698 --> 19:48.690
A transfiguration.

19:54.170 --> 20:01.606
Be transformed. Be transformed. Transformed.

20:05.018 --> 20:11.098
I like this. I could sit on this verse, I could be on this verse for a month, every day.

20:12.138 --> 20:18.938
Be transformed so I can be transformed. He's saying, you know what it is, this, I said it's

20:18.938 --> 20:30.698
a metamorphosis. It's a change from one state to another, yet it's the same life. The same life.

20:38.682 --> 20:43.242
A transformation, a transfiguration.

20:43.242 --> 20:50.570
So I was like this, now I have become like this.

20:50.570 --> 20:55.290
Maybe I used to be someone who was always afraid.

20:55.290 --> 20:57.610
That has changed.

20:57.610 --> 21:02.290
That has changed.

21:02.290 --> 21:07.510
Maybe I was loquacious, talkative.

21:07.510 --> 21:09.330
That has changed.

21:09.330 --> 21:13.262
He didn't tell me to try to change.

21:13.262 --> 21:17.882
Because if I tried, from today I won't talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.

21:17.882 --> 21:20.082
From today I won't misuse my mouth.

21:20.082 --> 21:21.982
He says that will not work.

21:21.982 --> 21:23.962
It's not those promises.

21:23.962 --> 21:24.962
He told us how.

21:24.962 --> 21:30.762
He says, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.

21:30.762 --> 21:35.550
Oh, renewing your mind.

21:35.550 --> 21:38.646
Renewing your mind.

21:38.646 --> 21:43.386
My personality will be altered by the renewing of my mind.

21:50.778 --> 21:54.278
If you want to become a bold person, it's not by saying,

21:54.278 --> 21:55.478
okay, I'm going to be bold now.

21:55.478 --> 21:58.478
No, he says by the renewing of your mind,

21:58.478 --> 22:05.462
you will be transformed into a bold and courageous person.

22:05.462 --> 22:09.162
If your life had been full of failure,

22:09.162 --> 22:15.234
it will change you to a man or woman of success.

22:15.234 --> 22:19.834
Be transformed by the renewing of your mind.

22:19.834 --> 22:25.134
So the key is the renewing of my mind.

22:25.134 --> 22:27.434
How can I renew my mind?

22:27.434 --> 22:30.734
It means change your way of thinking.

22:30.734 --> 22:32.534
How can I change my way of thinking?

22:32.534 --> 22:39.034
I can only think upon the materials that I have received.

22:39.034 --> 22:39.934
You see that?

22:39.934 --> 22:45.934
Which means I can only think through the information that I have.

22:45.934 --> 22:49.434
I process the information that comes to me.

22:49.434 --> 22:50.834
So what am I going to do?

22:50.834 --> 22:58.374
I must change the information that I receive.

22:58.374 --> 23:00.874
I must begin to process new information.

23:00.874 --> 23:06.074
It's actually a reprogramming of that human person.

23:06.074 --> 23:08.374
A reprogramming.

23:08.374 --> 23:10.074
A reprogramming.

23:10.074 --> 23:12.674
Some people have been programmed for failure in life.

23:12.674 --> 23:14.674
It doesn't matter what happens, they're going to fail.

23:14.674 --> 23:16.774
It doesn't matter where you put them, they're going to fail.

23:16.774 --> 23:17.374
Why?

23:17.374 --> 23:20.274
The programming started a long time ago.

23:20.274 --> 23:24.574
They've been programmed for failure and they have never reprogrammed themselves.

23:24.574 --> 23:27.174
It doesn't matter what happens, they're going to fail.

23:27.174 --> 23:31.874
See, I tell people it doesn't matter what you score in class, in school.

23:31.874 --> 23:37.978
It matters what you score in life.

23:37.978 --> 23:44.006
Some have distinctions in school but they have a D in life.

23:44.006 --> 23:49.978
Things just don't work out well.

23:49.978 --> 23:54.078
Their success in anything doesn't show in their life.

23:54.178 --> 24:01.178
Their life is just a failure because they were programmed for failure.

24:01.178 --> 24:04.474
And they can't understand why.

24:04.474 --> 24:06.074
Be transformed.

24:06.074 --> 24:12.074
It says be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.

24:12.074 --> 24:14.274
By the renewing of your mind.

24:14.274 --> 24:16.174
Reprogram your mind.

24:16.174 --> 24:17.874
Renew your mind.

24:17.874 --> 24:18.974
How?

24:18.974 --> 24:20.774
Receiving new information.

24:20.874 --> 24:26.674
For example, now that you are born again, the Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5, verse 17,

24:26.674 --> 24:31.674
if any man is in Christ, he is a new creation.

24:31.674 --> 24:32.874
So what?

24:32.874 --> 24:37.674
I say, now that I am in Christ, I am a new creation.

24:37.674 --> 24:40.074
This is new information.

24:40.074 --> 24:42.274
I am a new creation.

24:42.274 --> 24:45.374
I'm not the creation of the past of failure.

24:45.374 --> 24:50.174
I'm a new creation, full of success and the life of God.

24:50.174 --> 24:52.474
So I know that God lives in me.

24:52.474 --> 24:54.674
I have the life of God in me.

24:54.674 --> 24:58.874
The things I used to suffer, maybe I was born with that disease.

24:58.874 --> 25:01.074
Maybe I was born with that infirmity.

25:01.074 --> 25:03.074
No, I'm not that way anymore.

25:03.074 --> 25:04.574
I got a new life.

25:04.574 --> 25:05.974
I'm a child of God now.

25:05.974 --> 25:07.674
A new creation now.

25:07.674 --> 25:11.574
See, my way of thinking has changed.

25:11.574 --> 25:14.074
See, I got new information.

25:14.074 --> 25:17.910
And it's spiritual information.

25:17.910 --> 25:23.154
The human person must be changed from within.

25:23.154 --> 25:28.266
From within.

25:28.266 --> 25:33.350
Glory to God.

25:33.350 --> 25:35.650
I'm a new creation.

25:35.650 --> 25:37.850
Got the life of God in me.

25:37.850 --> 25:41.190
Life of God in me.

25:41.190 --> 25:42.990
You say that all the time.

25:42.990 --> 25:45.690
I got the life of God in me.

25:45.690 --> 25:48.890
In my spirit, my soul, and my body.

25:48.890 --> 25:51.690
I'll never be sick.

25:51.690 --> 25:53.290
Hallelujah.

25:53.290 --> 25:56.690
Got the life of God in me.

25:56.690 --> 25:58.190
Hallelujah.

25:58.190 --> 26:00.290
I'm a success.

26:00.290 --> 26:03.190
Because I have the life of God in me.

26:03.190 --> 26:06.090
The greater one lives in me.

26:06.090 --> 26:09.390
You see, this is new information from the Word of God.

26:09.390 --> 26:13.090
And I'm being reprogrammed.

26:21.818 --> 26:25.818
So when others say life is hard, I can't think like that.

26:25.818 --> 26:29.818
I can't think like that because my mind has been renewed,

26:29.818 --> 26:32.818
has been reprogrammed,

26:32.818 --> 26:40.610
and I've become an oasis of love in a troubled world.

26:40.610 --> 26:45.610
I'm different. I think differently.

26:45.610 --> 26:47.906
Say that. Say I'm different.

26:47.906 --> 26:48.906
I'm different.

26:48.906 --> 26:49.906
I think differently.

26:49.906 --> 26:51.906
I think differently.

26:51.906 --> 26:52.906
Say it again.

26:52.906 --> 26:56.522
I'm different. I think differently.

26:56.522 --> 27:04.522
I'm a success irrespective of the surrounding situation.

27:04.522 --> 27:05.818
Say that with me.

27:05.818 --> 27:15.530
I'm a success irrespective of the surrounding situation.

27:15.530 --> 27:17.666
Yeah.

27:17.666 --> 27:23.666
Because I am a light in a dark world.

27:23.666 --> 27:25.666
That's it.

27:25.666 --> 27:28.666
I'm a light in a dark world.

27:28.666 --> 27:34.666
The darker the world around me, the brighter I shine.

27:34.666 --> 27:41.082
So when life looks dark, don't cry with the others.

27:41.082 --> 27:43.082
They've been programmed for that darkness.

27:43.082 --> 27:48.082
Be not conformed to this world of darkness and pain and failure.

27:48.082 --> 27:51.082
Don't conform to that world around you.

27:51.082 --> 27:56.082
Don't seek the same solutions that they try.

27:56.082 --> 28:02.082
But be transformed, transfigured, transformed from glory to glory

28:02.082 --> 28:06.082
by the renewing of your mind.

28:06.082 --> 28:10.210
Glory to God.

28:10.210 --> 28:13.210
Say I know who I am.

28:13.210 --> 28:15.210
Say it again. I know who I am.

28:15.210 --> 28:18.210
I'm a success.

28:18.210 --> 28:22.210
This world belongs to me.

28:22.210 --> 28:27.978
Glory to God.

28:27.978 --> 28:30.978
Hey, hey, hey.

28:30.978 --> 28:33.978
This world belongs to me.

28:33.978 --> 28:39.170
Thank you Lord.

28:39.170 --> 28:41.170
He said he's talking as if he owns the world.

28:41.170 --> 28:45.562
They didn't know. It's true.

28:45.562 --> 28:47.562
They're just trying to find out.

28:47.562 --> 28:49.562
So why do you talk like you own the world?

28:49.562 --> 28:52.562
You mean you didn't know?

28:52.562 --> 28:55.562
I inherited it.

28:55.562 --> 28:58.562
They said what do you mean by that?

28:58.562 --> 29:01.562
I inherited it.

29:01.562 --> 29:04.562
The world belongs to me. I inherited it.

29:04.562 --> 29:09.562
Now, don't matter. You know, you can own a property that some tenants are on

29:09.562 --> 29:11.562
and they are saying we ain't moving.

29:11.562 --> 29:13.562
And it's been wheeled to you.

29:13.562 --> 29:16.562
And you have the document that shows it belongs to you.

29:16.562 --> 29:20.562
And you may be living on it, but it's yours.

29:20.562 --> 29:23.562
You didn't get that?

29:23.562 --> 29:25.562
It don't matter who's where.

29:25.562 --> 29:28.562
This world is mine.

29:28.562 --> 29:34.394
Hallelujah.

29:34.394 --> 29:36.394
It's mine.

29:36.394 --> 29:39.394
The rest of them are tenants.

29:39.394 --> 29:45.034
Glory to God.

29:45.034 --> 29:48.034
So walk like it belongs to you.

29:48.034 --> 29:50.034
Act like it belongs to you.

29:50.034 --> 29:52.034
Talk like it belongs to you.

29:52.034 --> 29:59.034
The Bible says the earth is the Lord's and the fullness of the world and all that being it.

29:59.034 --> 30:04.034
And we are joint heirs with Christ.

30:04.034 --> 30:06.034
Joint heirs.

30:06.034 --> 30:09.034
He got it by inheritance.

30:09.034 --> 30:11.034
And gave it to me.

30:11.034 --> 30:14.034
So I inherited it.

30:14.034 --> 30:17.034
Say it with me. I inherited it.

30:17.034 --> 30:20.034
Say have a different mentality.

30:21.034 --> 30:24.034
Glory to God.

30:26.034 --> 30:30.034
Be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind

30:30.034 --> 30:37.034
that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.

30:37.034 --> 30:40.034
Mine, oh mine.

30:40.034 --> 30:43.034
I can prove the will of God in my life.

30:44.034 --> 30:47.682
By renewing my mind.

30:47.682 --> 30:50.362
Thank you Lord Jesus.

30:50.362 --> 30:52.362
Praise God.

30:52.362 --> 30:53.362
Alright.

30:53.362 --> 30:56.362
Now, another thought.

30:56.362 --> 30:58.362
You there?

30:58.362 --> 31:01.362
We're talking about the human spirit, okay?

31:01.362 --> 31:07.362
And our man is primarily a spirit being.

31:08.362 --> 31:11.658
He's a spirit being.

31:11.658 --> 31:14.658
You are a spirit being.

31:14.658 --> 31:17.658
A spirit personality.

31:17.658 --> 31:21.050
You have a soul.

31:21.050 --> 31:25.274
You have a body.

31:25.274 --> 31:27.274
You live in your body.

31:27.274 --> 31:29.274
Your body is your house.

31:29.274 --> 31:32.274
Your body is your domicile. That's where you live.

31:32.274 --> 31:36.498
But your body is not you.

31:36.498 --> 31:40.530
You're a spirit.

31:40.530 --> 31:43.530
Say I'm a spirit.

31:43.530 --> 31:46.530
Say it again. I'm a spirit.

31:47.530 --> 31:49.530
I'm a spirit.

31:49.530 --> 31:56.530
You know some people have only been trained to enjoy soulish things.

31:56.530 --> 32:00.530
They've never been trained to enjoy spiritual things.

32:00.530 --> 32:04.530
They are bored by spiritual things.

32:05.530 --> 32:08.530
They enjoy soulish things.

32:08.530 --> 32:10.530
Just play some videos.

32:10.530 --> 32:16.530
They can watch three video programs of three hours each.

32:16.530 --> 32:17.530
That's nine hours.

32:17.530 --> 32:20.530
They just sit down on one chair. You'd be amazed.

32:20.530 --> 32:22.530
Just sitting there and watching, cross this leg.

32:22.530 --> 32:25.530
After about two hours they cross the other leg.

32:25.530 --> 32:30.530
And they finish one video, put the other one.

32:31.826 --> 32:32.826
They put the other one.

32:32.826 --> 32:34.826
The whole Saturday is burned like that.

32:34.826 --> 32:36.826
They just keep watching.

32:36.826 --> 32:38.826
They just feel sleepy like this.

32:38.826 --> 32:40.826
I almost missed that.

32:42.826 --> 32:47.426
Nine hours!

32:52.826 --> 32:54.826
Nine hours!

32:55.106 --> 32:57.106
Or the sports channel.

32:58.186 --> 33:02.326
Football, how many minutes for one match?

33:03.986 --> 33:07.226
They finish that one, they look for another one that is still on.

33:08.626 --> 33:11.226
That one, okay, they start watching that one.

33:12.226 --> 33:14.566
Three hours gone. A third match.

33:16.226 --> 33:18.226
Or Saturday and Sunday.

33:19.146 --> 33:21.146
Then finally they get up.

33:27.322 --> 33:29.322
Stretching.

33:29.802 --> 33:33.218
They've been working. That's work.

33:34.918 --> 33:38.662
What mind will you have until you start dreaming?

33:43.706 --> 33:45.706
That becomes it. In the night you'll be dreaming.

33:45.706 --> 33:47.706
You may just do this.

33:47.706 --> 33:49.706
You thought you were heading the ball.

33:51.706 --> 33:53.706
You wake up on your bed.

33:58.362 --> 34:00.362
Or you wake up saying, it's a goo.

34:03.138 --> 34:05.998
Because it's what you have that will come out of you.

34:08.018 --> 34:10.562
You know all the footballers in Europe.

34:11.482 --> 34:18.362
Nobody knows them like you. In fact, you boast of it. There's no one I don't know. Do you know the disciples of Jesus?

34:20.762 --> 34:23.602
The books of the Bible, they're only 66. You don't know them.

34:23.602 --> 34:29.978
Open to 1 Thessalonians, you went to Genesis.

34:31.578 --> 34:33.578
Those books are very rare ones.

34:35.258 --> 34:38.858
This one the pastor is quoting, very rare. They're not rare.

34:40.738 --> 34:45.578
You spent your Saturday and Sunday watching football. They're not rare.

34:47.578 --> 34:51.178
The Bible says to be carnally minded is death.

34:51.178 --> 34:55.378
To be carnally minded is death.

34:56.898 --> 35:01.218
What is it to be carnally minded? It means to be ordinary,

35:02.618 --> 35:04.218
earthly,

35:04.218 --> 35:06.218
base,

35:06.298 --> 35:08.298
earthly.

35:08.738 --> 35:18.170
He says that is the road of death. But to be spiritually minded is life and peace.

35:18.370 --> 35:27.370
He says that carnal mind is enmity against God and that it is not subject to the will of God.

35:27.770 --> 35:32.170
Neither indeed can be. That means it cannot even be subject to the will of God.

35:34.050 --> 35:41.842
So some people are training themselves to be more carnal, to be more and more carnal, more and more carnal, more and more carnal.

35:43.522 --> 35:45.522
By the materials they digest.

35:47.122 --> 35:50.666
That's all they're interested in.

35:52.066 --> 35:54.530
From sports channel to cartoon network.

35:57.274 --> 36:03.994
Parents be careful. When you see your children watching cartoon, you think they are for children. You'd be amazed what's in those cartoons.

36:04.994 --> 36:07.434
Some of them are the dirtiest thing on TV.

36:08.714 --> 36:10.714
Many parents don't know. When they just see them, they say,

36:13.074 --> 36:15.994
say it's children's program. It's not children's program.

36:17.354 --> 36:19.794
Those things are dangerous. They're not children's programs.

36:20.794 --> 36:23.114
These things have been carefully crafted

36:24.954 --> 36:26.954
to mislead a whole generation.

36:28.714 --> 36:33.882
So you've got to train your children to stop watching those things. They have to be selective.

36:34.842 --> 36:38.842
Don't take everything into you. Do you eat everything in the plate?

36:39.762 --> 36:41.762
Some people do.

36:42.962 --> 36:46.122
Some people do.

36:46.682 --> 36:49.074
They eat everything.

36:50.074 --> 36:52.786
Some things are not good for you.

36:54.066 --> 36:59.034
Some things are not good for you. Why do you think a lot of people get sick?

37:00.994 --> 37:03.258
Because they don't listen to God's Spirit.

37:04.498 --> 37:06.498
Some things are not good for you.

37:07.818 --> 37:12.882
Just not good for you. God doesn't want you taking everything.

37:14.682 --> 37:18.226
He doesn't want you going everywhere.

37:19.466 --> 37:21.506
He doesn't want you singing every song.

37:22.066 --> 37:24.586
Now you are so uncontrollable that

37:26.306 --> 37:28.306
everywhere you are, you are dancing.

37:30.786 --> 37:35.746
And a lot of times, it's not even Christian music that's going on.

37:35.746 --> 37:39.346
You're already dancing before you realize that you are helping to praise the devil.

37:41.386 --> 37:44.666
Listen, what are you dancing at? I didn't know.

37:46.026 --> 37:48.026
Everything moves you.

37:48.066 --> 37:50.066
Everything moves you.

37:50.066 --> 37:55.562
Everywhere you are, just across the road, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, you are going like this.

37:59.594 --> 38:02.594
Everything moves you. Your life shouldn't be that way.

38:04.442 --> 38:10.410
Self-control is from your spirit.

38:10.410 --> 38:12.410
It says the fruit of the spirit is

38:16.138 --> 38:19.138
self-control. You must have self-control.

38:20.194 --> 38:22.554
Until your spirit recognizes these things.

38:22.874 --> 38:27.914
You don't just dance at everything, everything. So long as it's music, my only is I convert it to praise God.

38:27.914 --> 38:31.354
But you have not converted, you are hearing it. It's from the world.

38:32.434 --> 38:34.434
You're dancing to it.

38:35.474 --> 38:40.266
You're dancing to it

38:42.642 --> 38:45.802
because of a lack of self-control.

38:47.442 --> 38:51.754
You didn't sing. It's not a sin. No, no, no.

38:51.754 --> 38:56.954
I didn't say that because you were dancing like that, you know, a guy found himself dancing and started punishing himself.

38:56.954 --> 38:59.114
No, no, no. Don't go on your knees and say, Father,

38:59.114 --> 39:04.234
I would kneel down for three hours because I was dancing to wrong music. No, it's not a sin.

39:04.474 --> 39:09.634
I'm not dealing with you sinning here. I'm talking about moving from the good to the best.

39:10.874 --> 39:16.274
Developing your human spirits, coming into excellence in your life. That's what I'm talking about.

39:17.674 --> 39:20.954
There's a higher life in Christ. That's what I'm talking about.

39:22.354 --> 39:24.354
Making progress in your life.

39:25.634 --> 39:30.266
There's some excellence.

39:31.146 --> 39:33.586
So you bring in self-control to your life.

39:37.802 --> 39:39.802
Self-control. You know when to stop.

39:41.642 --> 39:45.314
You must see the end of this film.

39:46.554 --> 39:50.914
You're watching it. You have an exam tomorrow morning. You must see the end of this film.

39:52.394 --> 39:54.394
You don't have self-control.

39:55.394 --> 39:59.066
Those people have made their money.

40:00.226 --> 40:02.426
You have an exam tomorrow morning.

40:04.146 --> 40:07.018
You are still watching this film.

40:08.018 --> 40:09.898
I must see the end of it.

40:09.898 --> 40:13.258
Just want to see the end. And then it's not ending. They just keep going.

40:13.258 --> 40:16.778
Meanwhile, the TV house didn't make a deal with you as to when to stop.

40:20.770 --> 40:25.410
Bringing some self-control. Success is from the human spirit.

40:27.450 --> 40:29.458
Real success.

40:30.298 --> 40:34.066
Until and unless

40:35.226 --> 40:37.226
your personality

40:37.626 --> 40:44.026
is altered to go in direction of the Word of God, to go in direction of the Spirit of God,

40:44.386 --> 40:46.506
you haven't begun to succeed at all.

40:48.506 --> 40:50.826
Because until a man has tamed himself,

40:52.386 --> 40:54.386
he's still a slave.

40:55.146 --> 41:01.514
Your greatest victory will be the victory over

41:03.594 --> 41:05.594
yourself.

41:05.794 --> 41:12.818
The Bible says a man that has no control over his spirit is like a city whose walls are broken down.

41:17.946 --> 41:40.650
You following this? Let me read something to you. You there? Romans chapter 9. Read for me verse 1.

41:51.386 --> 41:53.386
Again.

42:01.466 --> 42:04.266
Paul said, I say the truth in Christ, I lie not.

42:04.266 --> 42:07.866
My conscience also bear me witness in the Holy Ghost.

42:07.866 --> 42:09.066
Witness in the Holy Ghost.

42:09.066 --> 42:14.266
My conscience, my conscience also bear me witness in the Holy Ghost.

42:14.266 --> 42:16.266
So, what's the conscience?

42:18.666 --> 42:22.706
The conscience really is the voice of your spirit.

42:24.770 --> 42:26.170
That's what the conscience is.

42:28.898 --> 42:31.298
The conscience is the voice of the human spirit.

42:37.562 --> 42:39.882
The conscience is the voice of the human spirit.

42:39.882 --> 42:42.242
And you can train your conscience.

42:42.242 --> 42:45.322
A man's conscience can be good or bad.

42:45.322 --> 42:50.722
A man's conscience can be pure or impure.

42:50.722 --> 43:06.010
A man's conscience can be a good check or allow him to do all that's wrong.

43:06.010 --> 43:11.090
You see, a man that's born again, when you're born again, your spirit is the one that's

43:11.090 --> 43:15.210
born again and has the life and nature of God.

43:15.210 --> 43:22.490
And so your conscience becomes a good guide.

43:22.490 --> 43:26.650
But your conscience is not God.

43:26.650 --> 43:31.466
Your conscience is the voice of your own spirit.

43:31.466 --> 43:37.754
And we allow or disallow according to knowledge.

43:37.754 --> 43:41.074
Because your conscience knows what he knows.

43:41.074 --> 43:46.538
He knows how much he knows.

43:46.538 --> 43:51.026
A man's conscience can be weak or strong.

43:51.026 --> 43:54.186
I can read all of this I'm telling you, to you from the scriptures.

43:54.186 --> 43:57.546
But this is the introductory part.

43:57.546 --> 44:03.066
In the next services, we'll progress and move deeper into the subject.

44:03.066 --> 44:09.722
So your conscience can be weak or strong.

44:09.722 --> 44:13.202
You train your spirit.

44:13.202 --> 44:18.282
As you train your spirit, remember I said the conscience is the voice of the spirit.

44:18.282 --> 44:19.722
Okay?

44:19.722 --> 44:24.042
So sometimes we say the conscience in place of the spirit.

44:24.042 --> 44:30.530
It's one and the same thing.

44:30.530 --> 44:34.970
But you train your conscience through the Word of God.

44:35.090 --> 44:39.890
Your conscience will easily and quickly accept God's Word.

44:39.890 --> 44:41.410
Because he has that nature of God.

44:41.410 --> 44:44.650
Your spirit has that nature of God.

44:44.650 --> 44:47.410
He has the nature of God.

44:47.410 --> 44:50.970
And yearns to serve God.

44:50.970 --> 44:54.650
Yearns to love God, to walk with God.

44:54.650 --> 45:00.310
That's why you find inside you, you always really love the things of God.

45:00.310 --> 45:02.930
You appreciate God's people.

45:02.930 --> 45:05.810
Lay down in your spirit.

45:05.810 --> 45:07.270
That's what you really want.

45:07.270 --> 45:08.530
That's what you really like.

45:08.530 --> 45:12.042
That's what you really enjoy.

45:12.042 --> 45:14.342
In your spirit.

45:14.342 --> 45:20.598
That's what your conscience really settles for.

45:20.598 --> 45:24.978
And you can train your conscience to go in that direction.

45:24.978 --> 45:31.570
To always accept the things of God, the Word of God.

45:31.570 --> 45:34.250
It is my conscience bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost.

45:34.250 --> 45:35.250
You notice that?

45:35.250 --> 45:37.330
Bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost.

45:37.330 --> 45:40.050
His conscience had come to oneness with the Holy Spirit.

45:45.018 --> 45:47.018
And that's what you have to begin to do.

45:47.018 --> 45:51.018
First is to recognize that you are a spirit being.

45:52.018 --> 45:54.250
That's the first thing to recognize.

45:54.250 --> 45:57.250
Now, in the use of the term spirit,

45:58.250 --> 46:04.250
from this very introductory part, I would like to explain something to you that will help you in our

46:07.250 --> 46:10.250
communication because of semantics.

46:10.250 --> 46:11.250
Now,

46:12.250 --> 46:14.250
the human being

46:15.250 --> 46:19.482
is, in the first sense,

46:20.482 --> 46:24.602
referred to

46:25.602 --> 46:28.570
in two ways.

46:29.930 --> 46:31.930
The inward man,

46:32.930 --> 46:33.970
number one,

46:34.970 --> 46:37.970
and the outward man.

46:38.970 --> 46:41.002
Okay?

46:41.002 --> 46:45.002
You have the inward man and you have the outward man.

46:45.002 --> 46:48.002
The inward man is the

46:48.002 --> 46:50.002
the spirit

46:51.002 --> 46:53.002
and his soul.

46:55.258 --> 46:57.258
That's the inward man.

46:57.258 --> 47:03.258
The outward man is the body and his senses.

47:03.258 --> 47:05.258
The five senses.

47:08.706 --> 47:09.706
That's the outward man.

47:09.706 --> 47:12.706
So, when they put a man on the stretcher

47:13.706 --> 47:16.706
and the doctors come in their masks,

47:16.706 --> 47:20.706
turn the light on, and start cutting through his body,

47:20.706 --> 47:25.706
looking into his intestines and everything, that's the man's body.

47:25.706 --> 47:28.706
That's all the outward man, the whole case that you see.

47:28.706 --> 47:33.706
All of that plumbing inside the body is all the outward man.

47:34.706 --> 47:38.874
The inward man is called another name,

47:38.874 --> 47:42.874
the hidden man of the heart.

47:43.874 --> 47:47.362
He's called the hidden man of the heart,

47:47.362 --> 47:51.362
which means you can't see him with your optical eyes.

47:51.362 --> 47:55.362
That's why, it doesn't matter what the doctors do, they can't find him.

47:55.362 --> 47:57.362
He's hidden.

47:57.362 --> 47:59.362
He's hidden from their eyes.

48:00.362 --> 48:05.138
You see, you can't see my inward man right now.

48:05.138 --> 48:08.138
You can only see my outward man.

48:08.138 --> 48:12.138
I can't see your inward man right now because he's hidden.

48:13.138 --> 48:18.042
God has hidden that man, but God sees him.

48:19.042 --> 48:21.978
God doesn't deal with the body.

48:22.978 --> 48:24.978
God doesn't deal with the outward man.

48:24.978 --> 48:27.978
You remember when Samuel the prophet went to the house of Jesse

48:27.978 --> 48:29.978
to anoint one of his sons.

48:29.978 --> 48:34.978
And when he saw the first son of Jesse, Eliab,

48:34.978 --> 48:37.978
he said, behold, the Lord's anointed is before him

48:37.978 --> 48:39.978
and wanted to anoint him to become king of Israel.

48:39.978 --> 48:42.978
And God said, no, don't anoint him for I have rejected him.

48:43.978 --> 48:46.754
Then God made a statement.

48:46.754 --> 48:51.754
He said, man looketh at the outward appearance.

48:53.242 --> 48:57.242
You see, so man can only see the outward appearance.

48:57.242 --> 49:00.242
He said, but God looks at the heart.

49:00.242 --> 49:04.242
God looks at the heart in the spirit.

49:04.242 --> 49:06.242
That's what God sees.

49:06.242 --> 49:09.242
But man looks at the outward appearance.

49:09.242 --> 49:14.242
Before you can see the inward man of anybody,

49:14.242 --> 49:16.242
it can only be by the Holy Ghost.

49:16.242 --> 49:21.018
The Bible says no man knows the things of a man

49:21.018 --> 49:24.018
save the spirit of man which is in him.

49:24.018 --> 49:31.954
So no man knows except the spirit of man that is in him.

49:31.954 --> 49:36.666
And of course, the Holy Ghost.

49:36.666 --> 49:39.666
Because the Bible says the Holy Ghost knows all things.

49:39.666 --> 49:44.898
And even the deep things of God, the Holy Ghost knows.

49:44.898 --> 49:48.906
So when you look at people, you can only see the outward man.

49:48.906 --> 49:50.906
You can see how they act.

49:50.906 --> 49:54.906
You can see everything, you know, but you can't see the hidden man.

49:54.906 --> 49:58.906
And that hidden man is the one that really counts with God.

49:58.906 --> 50:03.978
That's the man that God seeks to save.

50:03.978 --> 50:05.978
That's the man that's born again.

50:05.978 --> 50:11.978
That's the man that receives eternal life.

50:11.978 --> 50:15.978
Now, even though that man has been born again,

50:15.978 --> 50:24.306
the way he lives will be controlled by his soul, his mind.

50:24.306 --> 50:31.626
Have you ever been sleeping and for some reason

50:31.626 --> 50:35.370
your head was, you were trying to run,

50:35.370 --> 50:40.986
your legs couldn't carry you?

50:40.986 --> 50:45.986
Or someone was pressing you or finding you in your sleep?

50:45.986 --> 50:48.986
This thing is more than a dream.

50:48.986 --> 50:55.994
And you're trying to push him away, but your hand was too heavy to move.

50:55.994 --> 51:00.994
And you're trying, but this hand is like lead.

51:00.994 --> 51:02.994
It's too heavy.

51:02.994 --> 51:07.258
Or you're trying to turn your face and your head is so heavy

51:07.258 --> 51:09.258
it's not turning for you.

51:09.258 --> 51:13.258
You're trying to call Jesus, your mouth is too tight to open.

51:13.258 --> 51:20.258
You're trying to, and this fellow, whatever it is, is pressing you.

51:20.258 --> 51:26.002
And you can't push back, you're trying.

51:26.002 --> 51:29.002
How many of you ever experienced such a thing?

51:29.002 --> 51:32.002
You did? Can I see your hand? Raise your hand.

51:32.002 --> 51:35.002
Look around and see who else experienced it.

51:35.002 --> 51:37.002
Raise your hand. Okay. Okay.

51:37.002 --> 51:41.002
What in the world was going on?

51:41.002 --> 51:43.002
What was going on?

51:43.002 --> 51:46.002
It was an activity of the spirit.

51:46.002 --> 51:53.002
The fellow that came on you to fight you

51:53.002 --> 51:56.002
wasn't fighting your body.

51:56.002 --> 51:59.586
He was fighting your spirit.

51:59.586 --> 52:04.394
And your spirit's trying to respond, but you see,

52:04.394 --> 52:07.394
you are encased in a physical body.

52:07.394 --> 52:11.394
And your body is sleeping, your spirit doesn't sleep.

52:11.394 --> 52:15.850
That's why it's not every dream that is an ordinary dream.

52:15.850 --> 52:18.850
There are different kinds of dreams.

52:18.850 --> 52:20.850
You understand?

52:20.850 --> 52:25.850
Most dreams are activities of the spirit.

52:25.850 --> 52:32.178
And when it's an activity of the spirit, it's difficult to wake that person up.

52:37.818 --> 52:41.306
Then you have the imagination.

52:41.306 --> 52:42.666
But all of this we will touch.

52:42.666 --> 52:44.666
So here's what happened.

52:44.666 --> 52:49.646
That fellow that came pressing you and fighting your spirit, you're trying to respond.

52:49.646 --> 52:51.226
You're trying to shout Jesus.

52:51.226 --> 53:00.106
You're trying, but it's not working because you're trying to communicate with your body.

53:00.106 --> 53:01.626
You see that?

53:01.626 --> 53:02.986
You're trying to communicate with your body.

53:02.986 --> 53:05.866
You're trying to use your mouth, but your mouth is sleeping.

53:05.866 --> 53:08.986
That's why he can't open, because he's sleeping.

53:08.986 --> 53:10.466
Why is your hand not moving?

53:10.466 --> 53:14.386
Because your spirit cannot react until this hand moves.

53:14.386 --> 53:17.786
So he's trying to get this hand to move, but this body is sleeping, so that's why it's

53:17.786 --> 53:18.786
heavy.

53:18.786 --> 53:30.234
There's a disconnect between the spirit and the body.

53:30.234 --> 53:39.130
Because the body has not been trained to be subject to his spirit.

53:39.130 --> 53:42.234
This is a dilemma.

53:42.234 --> 53:48.258
The body has not been trained to be subject to his spirit.

53:48.258 --> 53:53.018
So his spirit is a prisoner of his body.

53:53.018 --> 53:58.306
Most people are still in the prison of their body.

53:58.306 --> 54:05.266
First Corinthians chapter 3, when you read from verse 1 down, he calls them body rude.

54:05.266 --> 54:12.746
When he says, the word carnal is translated body rude, it means they are ruled by their

54:12.746 --> 54:13.746
body.

54:13.746 --> 54:17.026
They are still the slaves of their body.

54:17.026 --> 54:19.946
They eat because their body wants it.

54:19.946 --> 54:21.946
Some are slaves of their mind.

54:21.946 --> 54:25.810
Their minds have not been renewed.

54:25.810 --> 54:30.810
Whatever their mind says is what they follow.

54:30.810 --> 54:34.714
Whatever they think is what they follow.

54:34.714 --> 54:39.514
They have not trained their minds to be subject to the will of God.

54:39.514 --> 54:43.634
Because the mind has not been renewed.

54:43.634 --> 54:47.114
So they are slaves of their mind, as others are slaves of their body.

54:52.794 --> 54:55.794
Even though his stomach is now very big.

54:55.794 --> 55:00.794
Until he has finished, until the body has finished with this food, he will not stop.

55:00.794 --> 55:02.794
He just keeps eating.

55:02.794 --> 55:06.794
Now he is so big, his stomach is tight.

55:06.794 --> 55:09.794
He says, I don't know why I can't stop eating. I just keep eating.

55:09.794 --> 55:11.794
I just keep eating.

55:11.794 --> 55:13.794
He is complaining.

55:13.794 --> 55:16.794
I don't know why I can't stop eating. I just keep eating.

55:16.794 --> 55:18.794
You just keep eating.

55:18.794 --> 55:21.794
Why can't you stop? He says, I don't know.

55:21.794 --> 55:23.794
Bring the food again.

55:23.794 --> 55:26.794
Can I have some?

55:26.794 --> 55:28.122
He will still have some.

55:28.122 --> 55:32.122
He is a slave of his body.

55:32.122 --> 55:36.706
You see that? He is a slave of his body.

55:36.706 --> 55:38.706
He is destroying his body.

55:38.706 --> 55:41.706
He is breaking down his body.

55:41.706 --> 55:46.154
But he is a slave of the body.

55:46.154 --> 55:49.154
The spirit is in a trap.

55:54.970 --> 55:58.874
What are you going to do about it?

55:58.874 --> 56:04.514
God doesn't want your life to go in that direction.

56:04.514 --> 56:06.634
Live in the life of a slave.

56:06.634 --> 56:15.354
He says, the one whom the Son sets free is free indeed.

56:15.354 --> 56:20.514
And God's word has brought you into that liberty of the Spirit.

56:20.514 --> 56:23.034
The Bible calls it the liberty of the sons of God.

56:23.034 --> 56:27.234
He says the whole creation also shall be brought into the liberty of the sons of God.

56:27.234 --> 56:28.234
There is a liberty.

56:28.234 --> 56:31.714
Now the sons of God there is the hewers of God.

56:31.714 --> 56:34.154
That means the developed sons of God.

56:34.154 --> 56:39.034
Those who have developed their human spirits, they have come into a realm of liberty.

56:39.034 --> 56:43.554
There's a realm of liberty where you are no slave to your mind, where you are no slave

56:43.554 --> 56:45.034
to your body.

56:45.034 --> 56:46.274
Hallelujah.

56:46.274 --> 56:52.914
Smith Wigglesworth, a great man of God many years ago, he's gone to be with the Lord now.

56:52.914 --> 56:55.674
He asked him, Mr. Smith, how are you doing?

56:55.674 --> 56:58.234
He said, I don't ask Smith how he does.

56:58.234 --> 57:03.530
I tell him how he does.

57:03.530 --> 57:05.650
You see that?

57:05.650 --> 57:06.650
How you doing?

57:06.650 --> 57:09.370
Do you listen to your body to tell what's going on?

57:09.370 --> 57:12.030
You're a slave of your body.

57:12.030 --> 57:15.610
You listen to your body to know whether or not you can go to work this morning, you're

57:15.610 --> 57:19.098
a slave of your body.

57:19.098 --> 57:21.978
You're still a slave of your body?

57:29.690 --> 57:31.690
Glory to God.

57:31.690 --> 57:34.690
I learned a long time ago,

57:34.690 --> 57:37.730
you can have the alarm in your soul.

57:37.730 --> 57:41.770
You want to wake up at 5.

57:41.770 --> 57:45.482
You choose.

57:45.482 --> 57:49.162
Start the alarm inside you.

57:49.162 --> 57:52.162
You'll wake up at 5.

57:52.162 --> 57:56.322
Now I know there are a lot of people who use the alarm clock.

57:56.322 --> 57:59.322
And you know what they do?

57:59.322 --> 58:02.322
They are sleeping, they just go around.

58:02.322 --> 58:05.322
Shut up.

58:05.322 --> 58:07.322
They keep sleeping.

58:07.322 --> 58:09.322
You think they'll get up?

58:09.322 --> 58:12.322
No, not all the time.

58:12.322 --> 58:14.458
Continue sleeping.

58:14.458 --> 58:17.458
Put the alarm inside you.

58:17.458 --> 58:19.458
Hallelujah.

58:19.458 --> 58:23.458
Say this with me, I'm going to develop my spirit.

58:23.458 --> 58:26.458
I'll develop my spirit

58:26.458 --> 58:29.458
to be a sure guide.

58:29.458 --> 58:31.458
Now when you want to make decisions,

58:31.458 --> 58:34.458
like important business decisions,

58:34.458 --> 58:37.458
alright, don't be in a rush.

58:37.458 --> 58:39.818
Okay, don't be in a rush.

58:39.818 --> 58:43.818
Important financial decisions, don't be in a rush.

58:43.818 --> 58:46.594
Don't be in a rush.

58:46.594 --> 58:49.594
Learn to listen to your spirit.

58:49.594 --> 58:53.794
Learn to listen to your spirit.

58:53.794 --> 58:56.962
If you learn to listen to your spirit, you'll be amazed

58:56.962 --> 58:59.962
how God will lead you.

58:59.962 --> 59:03.442
They say, look, you have to make a decision.

59:03.442 --> 59:05.442
Actually, this has been going on since.

59:05.442 --> 59:08.442
I just heard now, and they say that it's closing tomorrow.

59:08.442 --> 59:10.442
Say, okay, if it's closing tomorrow, give me some time.

59:10.442 --> 59:11.442
Can I have some five hours?

59:11.442 --> 59:12.442
They say, ah, in three hours time it will close.

59:12.442 --> 59:14.442
Okay, give me two hours.

59:14.442 --> 59:16.442
You need time.

59:16.442 --> 59:17.442
You see it?

59:17.442 --> 59:22.442
You need time to assess the situation in your spirit.

59:22.442 --> 59:24.738
In your spirit.

59:24.738 --> 59:29.738
Your spirit knows God, and God knows everything.

59:29.738 --> 59:31.258
You see that?

59:31.258 --> 59:35.258
You can always receive the information that you require.

59:35.258 --> 59:40.258
Listen, the easiest thing in the world is to listen to God.

59:40.258 --> 59:41.258
Many people don't know that.

59:41.258 --> 59:42.258
They think it's hard.

59:42.258 --> 59:44.258
They say, okay, but if God is speaking, how am I going to know?

59:44.258 --> 59:45.258
You will know.

59:45.258 --> 59:46.258
That's the reason for this discussion.

59:46.258 --> 59:48.258
Come on.

59:48.258 --> 59:51.258
He says, my sheep know my voice.

59:51.258 --> 59:53.258
You will know.

59:56.218 --> 59:57.218
Give him equal time and see.

59:57.218 --> 59:59.218
You will know.

59:59.218 --> 01:00:00.610
Just be patient.

01:00:00.610 --> 01:00:01.610
You will know.
